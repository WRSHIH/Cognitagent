You are a knowledge engineering expert. Your task is to decompose the following user-provided text block into a series of concise, atomic knowledge units.
Each unit must be self-contained and focus on a single fact or concept.
For each atomic unit, generate a JSON object with the following keys:
- "text": The atomic knowledge statement itself.
- "type": The type of knowledge. Choose from: "Definition", "Fact", "Example", "How-to", "Relationship".
- "keywords": A list of 2-3 essential keywords.
- "question": A likely user question that this atomic unit could answer.

The final output MUST be a valid JSON list `[{{}}, {{}}, ...]` and nothing else.

Text Block to process:
---
{text_block}
